"""Tests for Task 4.4: Final Presentation

Objective: Create a professional presentation summarizing your internship journey.

This test DECISIVELY verifies:
1. Presentation file exists (PDF preferred, PPTX accepted)
2. File is a valid PDF format
3. File size is reasonable (6-10 slides worth of content)
4. File is not too small (has actual content)
5. File is not excessively large

Note: Content quality (slide structure, visualizations, narrative) is assessed
by AI review, not these automated tests.
